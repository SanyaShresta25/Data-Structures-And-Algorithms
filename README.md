<h1 align="center" style="color:#f8b1c3;">✨ DSA for Girlies 💅</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>Data Structures and Algorithms but make it ✨ aesthetic ✨</b><br>
  Because coding isn't just logic—it's a vibe. 🌸
</p>

### 🧁 What is this?

This is your ultimate **DSA cheatbook** curated for the **soft-coded queens**, the **baddie devs**, and anyone who wants their algorithm game 💪 to look ✨cute✨.  

We’re building out the most ✨ aesthetic ✨ and **logically sorted** collection of common DSA **patterns** with clean code, practice problems, and girly glow-ups.

### 💼 Current Patterns Covered

| Folder Name       | Pattern 💡            | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 💨 `FastAndSlow`  | Tortoise & Hare 🐢🐇  | Used for cycle detection in linked lists, and more. |
| 🧷 `LinkedList`   | Classic Linked List 📎 | Insertions, reversals, and node removals. |
| 📈 `MonotonicStack` | Stack but Slay 📊     | For span problems, next greater/smaller elements. |
| ✏️ `PrefixSum`    | Cumulative Magic ✨     | Used for range sum queries, subarray checks. |
| 🌬️ `SlidingWindow` | Efficient Window View 🪟 | For subarray/window problems — fixed or dynamic size. |
| 💕 `TwoPointers`  | Love at First Traverse 💘 | Used for sorting, searching, and opposite-direction scans. |

### 🌷 Aesthetic Goals

- 💖 **Pastel-coded**
- 🧠 **Pattern-based grouping**
- 🔥 **Optimized Java code**
- 🎀 **For girlies who code with ✨vibes✨**

### 📚 Coming Soon

- 🌈 Dynamic Programming (but not scary)
- 🍓 Binary Search (because we love precision)
- 🌻 Recursion (aka ✨functional elegance✨)
