### 🔗 What is a Linked List?

A **linked list** is a data structure made of **nodes**, where each node holds:
- a **value**, and 
- a **pointer to the next node**.

---

### 📦 Looks like this:
```
[10] → [20] → [30] → null
```

Each node points to the next, forming a **chain**.

---

### 🧠 Why use it?

- **Easy insertion/deletion** (no shifting like arrays)
- Good for **dynamic memory usage**

---

### 🆚 Compared to arrays:
- ✅ Flexible size  
- ❌ Slower access (`O(n)` to get an element vs `O(1)` in arrays)
